A semi-robust task tracking web application. For my current full-time job, I need a simple app that keeps track of my daily 
tasks and the amount of time I spend on them. I looked around for an app like that, but all that I can find are either some 
type of calendar app or apps that are way too overkill for my need. So I set out to build my own app to help with my daily 
workflow.<br />
<br/>
This is a very simple task tracking application that focuses on providing users with an overview of their weekly activities.
I focus on simple UI design that I hope to deliver the best experience to users. This is the first of many phases of this 
application. There's a lot more features I want to continue to add to the application. But for right now, you can check out 
what I have built so far.<br />
